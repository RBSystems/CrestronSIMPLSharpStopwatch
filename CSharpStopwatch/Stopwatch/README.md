# CrestronSIMPLStopwatch
Crestron SIMPLSharp stopwatch demo program

## Synopsis

This program is a stopwatch for a Crestron system.

A CSharp WinForms app is included because it was where the program started, start, stop and lap works on the Forms app but the rest was never finished once the Crestron program was done. It may be useful for somebody though. Feel free to add to it and send a pull request.


## Motivation

A client needed a stopwatch on their Crestron panels in an auditorium to keep track of show times on stage.

## Installation

Compiling the Crestron code creates a *.clz file.
Copy the *.clz and *.usp files into your Crestron userSplus directory.
Compiling the SIMPL+ *.usp file creates a *.ush file.
The module now appears in your SIMPL database, use it.

## API Reference

The code is the current documentation, feel free to create some and submit a pull request. 

## Tests

Tests are no testes implemented, feel free to create some.
